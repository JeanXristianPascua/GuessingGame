# GuessingGame

## Project Overview

This project is a simple browser-based guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback on each guess, informing the user whether the guess was too high, too low, or invalid. The game continues until the user guesses the correct number or chooses to quit.
